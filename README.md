# Quantum Digital Signature (QDS) Simulation  

This project simulates a **Quantum Digital Signature (QDS)** protocol, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure secure and tamper-proof message authentication. The simulation demonstrates how quantum states can be used to generate and verify digital signatures in a secure communication setup.  

## Features  
- **Signature Generation**: Simulates the creation of quantum signatures using entangled quantum states.  
- **Signature Verification**: Ensures authenticity and integrity of messages by simulating quantum state measurement.  
- **Error Detection**: Identifies any tampering attempts during message transmission.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Qiskit**: For designing and simulating quantum circuits.  
- **Python**: Core language for implementing the QDS protocol.  
- **NumPy**: For state vector calculations and data manipulation.  

## Usage  
Run the simulation to observe the process of generating and verifying quantum digital signatures for binary messages.  

## Applications  
- Authentication in quantum communication networks.  
- Advanced cryptographic protocols for secure communication.
